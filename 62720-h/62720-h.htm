Delivery</i>, &amp;c.</h1>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Whatever may be the Fate of
this Account, I think my
self indispensably obliged
to relate the Facts that I saw,
and transacted my self, as also the
Reasons which first induced me to enquire
into the Truth of such an Extraordinary
Event; but I here declare
that I take on me no other Part of
this Narration, than that in which I was
actually concerned.</p>

<p>As Mr. <i>Howard</i> himself intends
shortly to publish the whole Account,
and prove every Circumstance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
it, by such Evidences as will put
this Matter out of all possibility of
Doubt, I must refer to him for several
Particulars here omitted.</p>

<p>And as it will be impossible to judge
impartially of this Fact, till the Evidences
abovemention’d are produced,
it cannot be doubted but all such Persons
as are not governed by Prejudice,
or some worse Motive, will suspend
their Judgment till these Facts come to
their Knowledge by a more certain
way, than by flying Reports and Conjectures.</p>

<p>The first Intelligence I received of
this Matter, was on the 5th Instant,
when I saw a very particular<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Account
of a Woman living at <i>Godlyman</i> lately
delivered of five Rabbets by Mr. <i>John
Howard</i>, Surgeon at <i>Guilford</i> in <i>Surrey</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
a Man of known Probity, Character,
and Capacity in his Profession,
who has practis’d Midwifery for above
these thirty Years.</p>

<p>This Account was again confirmed
by two <a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>Letters from the said Mr.
<i>Howard</i>, the first dated <i>Nov.</i> the
6th, 4 a Clock in the Afternoon; the
Substance of which is, That from the
4th Instant to the 6th he had deliver’d
the Woman of three more Rabbets;
that the last of them had leap’d
in her Belly, for the space of eighteen
Hours, before it dy’d, and that the
Moment it was taken away, another
was perceiv’d to struggle for Birth.</p>

<p>The second is dated <i>Nov.</i> the ninth,
and is here transcribed <i>verbatim</i>, viz.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="dcap">Since I wrote to you, I have taken
or deliver’d the poor Woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
of three more Rabbets, all three
half grown, one of them a dunn Rabbet;
the last leap’d twenty three Hours
in the <i>Uterus</i> before it dy’d. As soon
as the eleventh Rabbet was taken away,
up leap’d the twelfth Rabbet,
which is now leaping. If you have
any curious Person that is pleased to
come Post, may see another leap in
her <i>Uterus</i>, and shall take it from her
if he pleases; which will be a great
Satisfaction to the Curious: If she had
been with Child, she has but ten Days
more to go, so I do not know how
many Rabbets may be behind; I have
brought the Woman to <i>Guilford</i> for
better Convenience.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>These Letters, with others to Persons
of Distinction in Town, which all
agreed with the above-mentioned,
were sufficient to make me desirous of
being convinced personally of a Fact
of which there was no Instance in Nature.
Accordingly on the 15th Instant,
I attended the Honourable Mr.
<i>Molyneux</i>, Secretary to his Royal
Highness the Prince of <i>Wales</i>, who
was inclin’d to enquire into the Truth
of this extraordinary Case, and desir’d
me to go with him to <i>Guilford</i>: We
arrived there at about half an hour after
two in the Afternoon. We sent
to Mr. <i>Howard</i>, who came to us immediately,
and told us that the Woman
was actually in Labour of the
fifteenth Rabbet. We had not been at
his House long, before the Nurse who
attends the Woman came to call Mr.
<i>Howard</i> to her, she being then in one of
her labour Pains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>She was lodged over against Mr.
<i>Howard</i>’s House, we found her dress’d
in her Stays, sitting on the Bed-side
with several Women near her. I immediately
examined her, and not finding
the Parts prepared for her Labour,
I waited for the coming on of fresh
Pains, which hapned in three or four
minutes, at which time I deliver’d her
of the entire Trunk, strip’d of its
Skin, of a Rabbet of about four
Months growth, in which the Heart
and Lungs were contained with the
Diaphragm entire. I instantly cut off
a piece of them, and tried them in
Water; they seemed but just specifically
lighter than it, and Mr. <i>Molyneux</i> pressing
them to the Bottom they rose again
very slowly; the Heart was very
large, and its <i>Foramen Ovale</i> entirely
open; the Lungs were remarkably
small, and of a much darker Colour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
than commonly the Lungs are of such
Rabbets, who have breathed for some
time. No Person but my self touch’d
her, from the first time that I had examined
her, to the time of her being
deliver’d by me: Her Pains were pretty
smart, and lasted for some Minutes;
they went off the Moment she was deliver’d,
and she seem’d chearful and
easy; walked by herself from the Bed-side
to the Fire, and sat on a Chair,
where I examined her; and found, that
in the Course of the <i>Fallopian Tubes</i>,
there were some Inequalities, but more
sensibly on the right side of her Belly;
which made me conjecture that the
Rabbets were bred in those Tubes,
and only came into the <i>Uterus</i>, when
they gave her those Agitations, which,
according to the account of Mr. <i>Howard</i>
and of several other Persons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
were sensibly felt many Hours before
their Exclusion.</p>

<p>As there was no Blood nor Water
that issued from the <i>Vagina</i>, after I
had delivered her, I again examined
that Part, and found it not in the least
inflamed or lacerated.</p>

<p>Upon examining her Breasts, I found
Milk in one of them, but only a little
yellowish <i>Serum</i> in the other.</p>

<p>Her Pulse was regular, but somewhat
low, her Tongue florid; and
upon asking for her Water, those about
her answered, she made very little,
and that they had not saved any.</p>

<p>She informed us, that in the Intervals
of her Labour-Pains she was tolerably
easy, and had no inclination
for any sort of Food but Beef.</p>

<p>About two Hours after we had left
her, they came again to call Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
<i>Howard</i>, she being at that Time in
violent Labour-Pains; but he and
my self were gone to see the Mayor,
who was then ill. The Nurse that attended
her had delivered her, before
our return, of the lower Part of a Male
Rabbet, which we found totally with
the Trunk, which I had before extracted:
This was also strip’d of its Skin,
and compleatly perfect in all its Parts,
but more manifestly so in those of
Generation.</p>

<p>In the <i>Rectum</i> of this Animal, which
remain’d affix’d to the Body, we found
five or six Pellets, much of the same
Colour and Consistence as the common
Dung of a Rabbet, little Bodies,
like dried Fragments, being matted
together with a mucous Matter. The
like was observed in some other Parts
of those Rabbets, which had come away
before. In the other Bowels there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
a dirty colour’d <i>Mucus</i>, of the Nature
of that which is constantly found
in the Bowels of all <i>fœtus</i> Animals,
and which in those that void their
Excrements in Pellets, is commonly
hard and dry; but the Matter in the
Guts of the first Animal was of an
entire different Kind, Colour and Substance
from any of the rest, this being
like little Filaments of an Animal
Substance. In the Middle of the Gut
<i>Ilium</i> of this Creature, I found a very
slender, brittle, white Body, of the
Length of half an Inch, which in Shape
was like a very small Fish-bones.</p>

<p>Between six and seven the same
Evening we again visited her; we
had not been there long, before she
fell into violent Labour-Pains, insomuch
that four or five Persons cou’d
hardly confine her to an Arm-Chair:
As soon as the Violence of the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Pain was somewhat abated, I examined
her as before, and found the <i>Vagina</i>
perfectly clear; and the Orifice of
the <i>Uterus</i> so far closed, as not to admit
of the little Finger, I constantly
stood before her, nor did any Person
whatsoever touch her, during that
Time. After three or four very strong
Pains, that lasted several Minutes, I
delivered her of the Skin of the above-said
Rabbet, rolled and squeezed up
like a Ball, without the least Moisture
or Blood about it; upon which she recovered
of her Pain.</p>

<p>From that Time I did not stir from
before her, nor did I withdraw my
Hand, but to deliver the Skin to a
stander by.</p>

<p>About ten Minutes after, as near
as I can judge, she again fell into Labour-Pains,
though more sudden and
short than the former; at which time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
I again deliver’d her of the Head of
the Rabbet, with the Furr on, part of
one of the Ears being torn off, also
without any Blood or Moisture: And
as to these two Deliveries, and particularly
as to the Circumstances of
the latter, Mr. <i>Molyneux</i> having drawn
up an Account of this whole Affair, for
his own private Satisfaction; immediately
upon our return to <i>London</i>, I beg
leave to refer, for the Conviction he had
of the Truth thereof, to that Account
which I have his leave to say, he will
communicate to any Gentleman that
is desirous to peruse it.</p>

<p>After this she soon grew easy, and Mr.
<i>Howard</i> gave her a sleeping Draught.</p>

<p>About ten in the Evening we saw
the Woman for the last Time, she
being then in Bed: Having felt her
Belly, I found it soft, except those
Lumps, which still were in the same
Place as before mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Between the Times of visiting the
Woman, we examined the several
Rabbets, which were all kept separate
in distinct Pots, with Spirits of Wine,
in the Order that they were brought
away.</p>

<p>The first Animal did not appear
to be a perfect Rabbet, in all its Parts,
three of the Feet being like the Paws
of a Cat, the Stomach and Intestines
like those Parts in the same Animal,
as also the Shape and Figure of the
<i>Thorax</i>; the Lungs and Heart of
which were entirely out of their natural
Situation, and squeezed out between
the upper Ribbs and <i>Vertebræ</i> of the
Neck, to which Parts they strongly
grew and adhered. The Lungs of
this Creature, had they been placed
in their natural Cavity, would not
have filled above a sixth Part of it:
The Bones of this Creature being also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
different in Substance and Structure,
from those of common Rabbets, the
Head and one Paw only excepted.</p>

<p>All the other thirteen Animals were,
in every Particular, like well formed,
common, natural Rabbets, from the Size
of two Months Growth to four. They
were all broken in Pieces, and much
in the same Manner. I shall describe
these pieces in the Order that Mr.
<i>Howard</i> told us they had commonly
been brought away. First the four Paws
with the Furr on; then the Liver and
Intestines; the Trunk and Shoulders in
another Part: In three or four Animals
the Loyns separated from the <i>Os Sacrum</i>;
and in the rest, the <i>Ischium</i>
and Thighs in one piece, with the
Loyns; the Head with its Furr, and
lastly the Skin.</p>

<p>When all these several Parts were
put together in their proper Order, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
manifestly made up, and appeared to
belong to the above-mentioned Animals:
But the <i>Viscera</i> were wanting in
four or five of them. One remarkable
Circumstance is, that most of
these Animals were Females, as far as
I could judge.</p>

<p>The Heart and Liver of those
which we examined, appeared much
larger than usual, when compared
with the <i>Lungs</i> and <i>Intestines</i> which
belonged to them; which on the contrary
were extremely small. The <i>Cœcum</i>
and <i>Colon</i>, which are remarkably
large in Rabbets, appeared not to exceed
in bigness the other Intestines, and
the spiral Structure of the <i>Cœcum</i> was
not yet unfolded; the Stomach was in
like manner much contracted, and its
<i>Pilorus</i> very streight and narrow. I
cou’d not discover, in any of the Livers
that I examin’d, the <i>Ductus Venosus</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
nor the implantation of the <i>Umbelical</i>
Vein in that Organ.</p>

<p>I open’d three or four of the Hearts,
and found in every one of them the
<i>Foramen Ovale</i>, and the <i>Ductus Arteriosus</i>
fully open, the two Trunks of the
Descendant <i>Cava</i> united at the right
Auricle of the Heart, agreeable to that
Structure which is peculiar to natural
Rabbets, and some few other Animals.</p>

<p>The Flesh of these Creatures, particularly
of that which I extracted, had
the smell of Rabbets just killed: and
the Substance of their Bones were, in
all respects, like the Bones of <i>Fœtus</i>
Rabbets; in several of them the <i>Epiphyses</i>
were separated from the Bones
themselves.</p>

<p>All the Heads which I examined
had their compleat number of Teeth,
four cutt before, and ten Grinders on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
each side, but they appeared not in
the least worn nor stained, as the Teeth
of other Rabbets are by Mastication.</p>

<p>The Nails of the Paws were most
of them exceedingly sharp.</p>

<p>The Skins were all produced, being
dress’d in Allum; they were of several
Colours, as to their Furr, which was
considerably long, and in one particularly
(which was the fifth Rabbet,)
that part which cover’d the Head was
curled.</p>

<p>The Rabbet which I extracted
weigh’d one and twenty ounces <i>Averdupoize</i>,
making an allowance for one
of the Paws not yet come away, and
part of the <i>Viscera</i> that were lost.</p>

<p>From all these Considerations I was
fully convinced, that at the same time
that the external Appearance of these
Animals was exactly like such Creatures,
as must inevitably undergo the Changes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
that happen to adult Animals, by
Food and Air, they carry’d within
them the strongest Marks of <i>Fœtus’s</i>,
even by such parts as cannot exist in
an Adult, and without which a <i>Fœtus</i>
cannot possibly be supposed to live.
This, I think, proves in the strongest
Terms possible that these Animals were
of a particular kind, and not bred in
a natural Way; nor will there be any
doubt remaining (even with the least
knowing in these matters) when those
parts which are subservient to the Circulation
of the Blood, and Nourishment
between an adult Creature and
its <i>Fœtus</i> are brought away; which I
am fully satisfied must shortly happen,
or, if retained, be the Cause of this
Woman’s Death.</p>

<p>All these Facts were verify’d before
his Majesty, on <i>Saturday Nov.</i> the 26th,
by the Anatomical Demonstration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the first, the third, fifth, and ninth of
these Animals, which were compared
with the parts of two natural Rabbets,
the one of the Age of four Months,
and the other of five Days, Dr. <i>Steigerthal</i>
and Dr. <i>Tessier</i> being present.</p>

<p>I shall with all convenient speed
publish the Anatomy of these Præternatural
Rabbets, with their Figures taken
from the Life, and compared with
the Parts of Rabbets of the same
growth, that the differences before
mention’d may be fully understood.</p>

<p>In the mean while, I shall relate
what appeared in the Dissection of two
Rabbets, which I performed in the
Presence of Mr. <i>Molyneux</i>, the very
Day that we returned from <i>Guilford</i>;
the one was of four Months growth,
and much of the Size of that which I
had taken from the Woman, the other
was barely fifteen Days old. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Lungs of the larger were, as nearly
as I can judge, twenty times bigger in
Capacity than those of the præternatural
one, and the Lungs of the smaller
were at least eight times the bigness of
the fore-mentioned; both these were
exceedingly different, in Colour and
Confidence, from those of the præternatural
Rabbet.</p>

<p>The <i>Foramen Ovale</i> of the smaller
Rabbet was more than two thirds open,
and that in the larger was so far
closed, as but just to admit a very
small Probe.</p>

<p>As to the Stomach and Intestines, the
difference was so notoriously great from
those we had examined, that even in
the sucking Rabbet, the Stomach and
<i>Cœcum</i> were at least three times larger
than those parts in the præternatural
ones.</p>

<p>I shall give no other Account of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Woman, than what I think pertinent
to this Subject: By the several Questions
which I put to her, I was informed,
that she was born and bred at <i>Godlyman</i>;
She seem’d to be of a healthy
strong Constitution, of a small size,
and fair Complexion; of a very stupid
and sullen Temper: She can neither
write nor read: She has been married
about six Years to one <i>Joshua Toft</i>,
Junior, a poor Journey-man Clothier
at <i>Godlyman</i>, by whom she has had
three Children. The account she further
gave of herself, was, that on the
23d of <i>April</i> last, as she was weeding
in a Field, she saw a Rabbet spring
up near her, after which she ran, with
another Woman that was at work just
by her; this set her a longing for Rabbets,
being then, as she thought, five
Weeks gone with Child; the other Woman
perceiving she was uneasy, charged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
her with longing for the Rabbet
they cou’d not catch, but she deny’d
it: soon after another Rabbet sprung
up near the same place, which she endeavour’d
likewise to catch. The same
Night she dreamt that she was in a
Field with those two Rabbets in her
Lap, and awaked with a sick Fit, which
lasted till Morning; from that time, for
above three Months, she had a constant
and strong desire to eat Rabbets,
but being very poor and indigent cou’d
not procure any. About seventeen
Weeks after her longing, she was taken
with a Flooding and violent Cholick
Pains, which made her to miscarry
of a Substance that she said was like
a large lump of Flesh. Three Weeks
after this, she was again taken with a
Flooding, and voided another Substance
like the former, but not so large.
Notwithstanding these Accidents, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
did not perceive her self to grow less,
but continued with the Symptoms of
a breeding Woman; insomuch that in
the beginning of <i>September</i>, as she was
working in the Hop-Ground, the
Milk flow’d profusely from her Breasts;
and as she had Children before, she
thought she felt very differently from
what she used to do. That on the
27th of <i>September</i> last she was taken
very ill in the Night, and sent for her
Mother in Law, who is a Midwife,
and a neighbouring Woman, at which
time she voided somewhat, which she
took to be the Lights and Guts of a
Pig, which her Husband carried to
Mr. <i>Howard</i>, who some Days afterwards
came to her and delivered her
of some parts of the Animal first mention’d.
After a Fortnight she was
Churched, and thought all was over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
with her. She told me that her Husband
had not cohabited with her, from
the time of her first Miscarriage; and
that after the first Rabbet was brought
away, she had one regular Menstrual
Evacuation.</p>

<p>The Account Mr. <i>Howard</i> gave
was, in every material Circumstance,
the same with the Woman’s Relation;
he said the Guts and Liver (as he
thought) of a Rabbet were brought
to him, but he never knew or heard
of the Woman or her Friends till
then, and that at first he took this to
be intended as an Imposition upon
him: but was at last with much Persuasion
prevailed on to go to assist her
at <i>Godlyman</i>; that he did accordingly
deliver her of part of the first Rabbet;
that he attended her at <i>Godlyman</i>, till
she was delivered of the ninth Rabbet;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
but that it being very inconvenient to
attend her there, which made him
neglect all his other Business, he had
brought her to <i>Guilford</i> for better Conveniency.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Howard</i> further related, that
when she was delivered of one Rabbet,
another was immediately felt in
her Belly, struggling with such Violence,
that the Motion thereof cou’d
be sensibly felt and seen: That this
Motion has sometimes been so strong,
as to move the Bed-Clothes, and that
it has lasted for twenty and above
thirty Hours together. This particular
Fact was unanimously agreed on,
and attested by most of the People
at <i>Guilford</i>, who have had the Curiosity
to go to see her, and was confirmed
to Mr. <i>Molyneux</i> and my self by
above ten different Persons, who all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
seemed to be indifferent in this Matter.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Howard</i> further told me, that,
during this Motion, she was always
free from Pain, and chearful; but
that immediately upon the ceasing of
it, she grew sick, and soon began to perceive
her Labour-Pains drawing near;
that upon her first Pains, the Bones
of the Animal were sensibly heard to
snap, and break by the violent convulsive
Motions of the <i>Uterus</i>: This last Circumstance
was likewise related by the
same Persons that attested the former.
He further added, that she had four
breakings of Waters in the coming of
the Rabbets, although in no great
Quantity.</p>

<p>On <i>Wednesday</i> the 23d Instant, I
set out again for <i>Guilford</i>, with Mr.
<i>D’Anteny</i>, being resolved to bring the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Woman to Town, if there was any
further prospect of more Rabbets.
We arrived there at one in the Afternoon,
and we found Mr. <i>Howard</i>
standing at his Door, who told us, that
she had been delivered of two more
Rabbets since I had seen her, and that
he hoped all was over, being he did
not perceive in the <i>Uterus</i> any Motion
as usual. I visited her several times
that Day, and proceeded in every respect
as before; her Pains, which,
when I saw her the first Time, were
mixed with intervals of Quiet and Rest,
now were constant and fixed on the right
Side of her Belly; her Pulse was more
irregular; she described her Pain as if
very coarse brown Paper was tearing
from within her. Toward eight a Clock
that Evening she voided a Piece of
one of the Membranes of a <i>Placenta</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
rolled up like Parchment; when it
was extended, it measured about six
Inches over. The next Morning, as
I was packing up some of the Rabbets
to bring to Town with me, Mr.
<i>Howard</i> was sent for over, and Mr.
<i>D’Anteny</i>, Dr. <i>Hampe</i>, and my self
attended him. We found her in exquisite
Torture, and after seven or
eight Minutes, she was again disburthen’d
of a Membrane, in Structure,
Shape and Size exactly like the former.
This was the first part that I saw
come from her with some effusion of
Blood. She did not seem in the least
relieved after this Operation, her Pulse
continued irregular, her Tongue white,
and her Urine deeply stained with a
<i>Mucus</i>, and livid <i>Blood</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. <i>Ahlers</i> having been at <i>Guilford</i>,
by his Majesty’s Order, (as Mr.
<i>Howard</i> told us) to enquire into the
Truth of this Fact, was fully convinced
of it, as he himself declared, having
assisted the greatest part of <i>Sunday</i>
the 20th instant, at the Delivery
of some of the 16th Rabbet, which
he brought to Town with him. But
as on this Occasion his Behaviour has
been represented here different from
what it was at <i>Guilford</i>, I cannot better
vindicate that Gentleman’s Character,
than by subjoyning the following
Affidavits, which were taken
in the presence of Mr. <i>D’Anteny</i>,
and Doctor <i>Hampe</i>. And that
the Truth, so far as it relates
to this Point, may be known,
I think he is strictly obliged, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Justice to the Publick, forthwith to
give an Account of what he saw and
transacted there; as I here have done.</p>

County of <i>Surrey</i> Surgeon, maketh
Oath, That on <i>Sunday</i> the twentieth
Day of this instant Month of
<i>November</i>, at or about ten a Clock
in the Morning, he this Deponent
was called home to a Person who
told him his name was <i>Ahlers</i>; that
he was come to see <i>Mary Toft</i>;
that he was ordered by his Majesty
to attend her till all was over; and
that he was Surgeon to his Majesty’s
<i>German</i> Houshold. And this Deponent
saith, That at that very time
the Nurse of the said <i>Mary Toft</i>
came to acquaint this Deponent,
that the said <i>Mary Toft</i> was in Labour:
And thereupon this Deponent
carried the said Mr. <i>Ahlers</i>
over to her with him, and having
touched her in his Presence, desired
him to examine her, for that he found
all things ready for a Delivery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
That Mr. <i>Ahlers</i> did accordingly
examine; but this Deponent finding
that he did not hasten her Delivery,
nor that he proceeded as one who
understands Midwifery should do,
this Deponent directed him how to
proceed in the Extraction, which
after some time Mr. <i>Ahlers</i> effected,
having brought away the Loins
and inferior Parts of a Rabbet, of
about three Months Growth. That
after this Mr. <i>Ahlers</i> told this Deponent,
and all the Persons present,
that he was fully satisfied, and convinced
of the Truth, and that he
could have no Doubts after such
Proofs. That at the same time he
gave the Woman a Guinea, expressing
great Satisfaction, and promising
that he would procure her a Pension
from his Majesty: That he repeated
the same Things to Mr. <i>Tho.
Howard</i> in this Deponent’s Presence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
nor did he offer any Objections or
Doubts to them. That some time
after Mr. <i>Ahlers</i> desired to touch the
Woman again; but as at the time
before he had put her to a great
deal of unnecessary Pain, this Deponent
desired him to forbear. That
some time after Mr. <i>Ahlers</i> said he
was not well, and that he must
hasten back to <i>London</i>. That this
Deponent pressed him to stay, that
he might assist at the bringing away
of the Remainder of the Rabbet, but
could not prevail on him; and soon
after he accordingly set out for
<i>London</i>, although it was almost
dark.</p>
